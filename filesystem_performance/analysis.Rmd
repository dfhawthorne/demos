## Overview

This blog post analyses the performance data produced on a Compaq desktop from the code in [do_perf_io_test.c](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/demos/blob/master/filesystem_performance/do_perf_io_test.c).

## Generate the Results

The following code is used to generate the results used in this analysis:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
./do_perf_io_test -n 5 dummy.dat >compaq_20200424.csv
```

This will the test five (5) times each for each of the following block sizes:
* 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536
