# High CPU and CDB Resource Plans

These scripts are used in my blog post [High CPU Usage with a CDB Resource Plan](https://yaocm.wordpress.com/2019/12/17/high-cpu-usage-with-a-cdb-resource-plan/).

Some of these scripts are duplicated from [Configure the Resource Manager](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/sql-ocm12c/tree/master/Data%20and%20performance%20management/Configure%20the%20Resource%20Manager) topic.
