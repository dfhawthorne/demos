Conversion to ARCHIVELOG Mode
-----------------------------

I decided to convert the SUT database to _ARCHIVELOG_ mode as a separate step
instead of doing remediation during normal startup as this would have
complicated the startup procedure. This remediation only happens once during the
life of the SUT database.
