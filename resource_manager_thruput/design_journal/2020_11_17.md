Design Journal Entry 2020-11-17
===============================

Overview
--------

A script, `create_test_server.yml`, uses the preinstallation RPM to setup the
software installation from a downloaded file.

Decisions Made During Installation

Installation Script
-------------------

The installation script was called `install_oracle19c.yml`. This name was not
fully descriptive as it leaves out that a database is created as well. Since the
script performs so functions, it may be hard to come up with a more descriptive
name.

However, the name, `create_test_server.yml`, is more generic, but does put
forward the purpose of the script. I changed the name to this.
 
Use of Preinstallation RPM
--------------------------

I have used this method before and am comfortable with it.

See [3 Automatically Configuring Oracle Linux with Oracle Preinstallation RPM](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/ladbi/automatically-configuring-oracle-linux-with-oracle-preinstallation-rpm.html#GUID-22846194-58EF-4552-AAC3-6F6D0A1DF794)
for more details.

Software Installation Options
-----------------------------

I have already downloaded and extracted the software into
`/opt/share/Software/database/linuxamd64_193000/`. I will not be using any of
the following:
- [Image-based Oracle Database Installation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/ladbi/about-image-based-database-installation.html#GUID-0315AA15-1C03-4E96-B801-3A8E5F5D4B39)
- [Oracle Fleet Patching and Provisioning](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/ladbi/about-deploying-oracle-database-using-rapid-home-provisioning.html#GUID-7166A69D-5C4F-4EFC-AF22-F940C2376491)
- [RPM Package to Install Oracle Database](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/ladbi/installing-oracle-database-using-rpm-packages.html#GUID-5AF74AC1-510E-4EB0-9BCA-B096C42C6A76)

These are either for mass deployments or for quick deployments. Since this is my
first installation of Oracle 19C, I will do it the traditional way.

No special character set is required.

I will not be using automatic memory management as I need to prevent performance
problems caused by incorrect memory settings.

I will be applying patch (`p31720396`) which is located in
`/opt/share/Software/database/p31720396_190000_Linux-x86-64`. This is:
