# New Repository

The fix to the problem was a simple (supply a missing return statement). I do
not want to burden the maintainer with such a trivial change.

I forked the [HammerDB](https://github.com/TPC-Council/HammerDB) repository to
[mine](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/HammerDB).

My repository was cloned onto __HAMMER__ into `/home/douglas/HammerDB`.

# Difficulty in Testing Fix

I have yet to find a way to test changes to my forked repository. As such, I
had to verify the change by sight.
