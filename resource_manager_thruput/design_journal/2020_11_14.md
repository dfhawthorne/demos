Design Journal Entry 2020-11-14
===============================

Overview
--------

A single Ansible playbook for the installation of the HammerDB software along with its prerequisites was chosen in
order to reduce the complexity of deployment with the risk of technical debt accruing.

Design of Script to Install HammerDB
====================================

Design Options
--------------

There are several options for the design of the script to install [HammerDB](https://hammerdb.com/):
1. [Ansible roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)
2. Single [Ansible playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html)

I chose to implement a single Ansible playbook for the installation of the HammerDB software along with its
prerequisites.

Ansible Roles
-------------

[Ansible roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html) is the preferred
method of implementing code reuse within [Ansible](https://ansible.com).

However, the use of roles increases the complexity of my GIT repositories as I would have refactor my
[ansible-ocm12c](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/ansible-ocm12c) repository. I would have to create a whole new
repository to contain the roles that are common between this [repository](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/demos) and
the [ansible-ocm12c](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/ansible-ocm12c) one.

This would also mean the cloning of this repository would entail the cloning of another one. My current experience
with [GITHub](https://github.com) precludes this option being seamless.

Single Ansible Playbook
-----------------------

A single [Ansible playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html) provides a deep
module as recommended by [John Ousterhout](http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/home.php) in his book,
[A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.amazon.com.au/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201).

This script does a single thing: install and configure HammerDB with an Oracle Client.

The name of the script is
[install_hammerdb.yml](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/demos/blob/master/resource_manager_thruput/install_hammerdb.yml).
This name is simple and describes its content. I did not consider any alternatives.

The main disadvantages are:
1. Replicated code from the [ansible-ocm12c](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/ansible-ocm12c) repository as I reuse
code for the installation of the Oracle 12C client.
2. Technical debt accumulates as I correct errors introduced by Ansible 2.10 removed many deprecated options I used for
the development of my older scripts. I will have to update those older scripts sometime in the future.

Despite these disadvantages, this is the option I chose.

Other Design Decisions
======================

Restriction of Operating System Supported
-----------------------------------------

I restricted the operating system to Oracle Linux 8 or newer because the complexity of maintaining backward
compatibility offerred me no advantages. This is meant to be a simple demonstration.

Separate Owners of Software
---------------------------

I used two (2) different sofware owners:
1. `hammer` for the HammerDB software
2. `oracle` for the Oracle 12C client

Both of these users cannot log in.

This was done for convenience.

Download Software Differently
-----------------------------

The HammerDB software was downloaded directly from the online repository. No credentials were required.

The Oracle 12C Client software had already been downloaded for my OCM12C systems. Credentials were needed to do this.
Best to keep this method as it protects my Oracle credentials.
