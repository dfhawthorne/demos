2020-12-19: SUT Test Preparation
================================

Overview
--------

I set up AWR snapshot collection, created a guranteed restore point, and
removed the dependency on the status of the Oracle listener from a previous
step.

Removal of Dependence on Listener Status
========================================

The Python3 script now checks the status of the database service directly
instead of relying on the output of the start listener script (which has been
removed).

The comments added in journal entry [2020-12-22](2020_12_22.md) have been
removed to reflect this.

I was able to overcome the difficulties I found in journal entry
[2020-12-17](2020_12_17.md). It was much easier than I feared. I think I have a
working model for the future.

Test Preparation
================

AWR Settings
------------

I want to take
[AWR snapshots](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/tgdba/gathering-database-statistics.html#GUID-144711F9-85AE-4281-B548-3E01280F9A56)
as required instead of relying on automatic ones.

During periods of high CPU load, the data collected by an AWR snapshot can be
unreliable as the data collection is severely impacted by the CPU scheduling.

Setting the interval between AWR snapshots to zero (0) disables the ability to
take any AWR snapshots. (See
[MODIFY_SNAPSHOT_SETTINGS](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/arpls/DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.html#GUID-E2B46878-1BDB-4789-8A21-016A625530F1)
for details.)

I decided to set the interval between snapshots and the retention of those
snapshots to 366 days. This should be adequate time for me to complete this
demonstration.

__Problems with Overloaded PL/SQL Procedure Calls__

Because
[MODIFY_SNAPSHOT_SETTINGS](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/arpls/DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.html#GUID-E2B46878-1BDB-4789-8A21-016A625530F1)
is an overloaded PL/SQL procedure, I cannot use Python3 code like:
```python
parms  = [366, 366, None, None, None]
cursor.callproc('DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.MODIFY_SNAPSHOT_SETTINGS', parms)
```
When I do, I get the following error messages
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/oracle/configure_sut_db.py", line 168, in <module>
    cursor.callproc('DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.MODIFY_SNAPSHOT_SETTING', parms)
cx_Oracle.DatabaseError: ORA-06550: line 1, column 32:
PLS-00302: component 'MODIFY_SNAPSHOT_SETTING' must be declared
ORA-06550: line 1, column 7:
PL/SQL: Statement ignored
```

To solve this, I had to use the following code:
```python
   sql = """
           DECLARE
             p_RETENTION              NUMBER := :retention;
             p_INTERVAL               NUMBER := :interval;
             p_TOPNSQL                        NUMBER := NULL;
             p_DBID                   NUMBER := NULL;
             p_TABLESPACE_NAME        VARCHAR2(128) := NULL;
           BEGIN
             dbms_workload_repository.MODIFY_SNAPSHOT_SETTINGS(
               "RETENTION"       => p_RETENTION,
               "INTERVAL"        => p_INTERVAL,
               "TOPNSQL"         => p_TOPNSQL,
               "DBID"            => p_DBID,
               "TABLESPACE_NAME" => p_TABLESPACE_NAME);
            end;"""
   parms = {"retention": new_retention, "interval": new_snap_interval}
   cursor.execute(sql, parms)
```

Guaranteed Restore Point
------------------------

In order to be able to reuse the same data, I need a
[guaranteed restore point](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/bradv/using-flasback-database-restore-points.html#GUID-2C846D84-EDCC-4FAA-9F6A-05CD0C6C7C09).

I choose the name to be `ORIGINAL_TPCC_DATA_RP`. This was set via a variable
called `original_data_rp` in the group variable file,
[all.yml](..inventory/group_vars/all.yml).

The suffix, `_rp`, is supposed to denote a restore point.
