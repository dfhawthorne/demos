State of Oracle DB Software Installation
========================================

Output from runInstaller
------------------------

The output from the latest execution of `runInstaller` was:
```
Launching Oracle Database Setup Wizard...

[WARNING] [INS-13014] Target environment does not meet some optional requirements.
   CAUSE: Some of the optional prerequisites are not met. See logs for details. installActions2020-11-19_06-23-29PM.log
   ACTION: Identify the list of failed prerequisite checks from the log: installActions2020-11-19_06-23-29PM.log. Then either from the log file or from installation manual find the appropriate configuration to meet the prerequisites and fix it manually.
The response file for this session can be found at:
 /opt/app/oracle/product/19.3.0.2/database/install/response/db_2020-11-19_06-23-29PM.rsp

You can find the log of this install session at:
 /tmp/InstallActions2020-11-19_06-23-29PM/installActions2020-11-19_06-23-29PM.log

As a root user, execute the following script(s):
        1. /opt/app/oraInventory/orainstRoot.sh
        2. /opt/app/oracle/product/19.3.0.2/database/root.sh

Execute /opt/app/oraInventory/orainstRoot.sh on the following nodes: 
[dural]
Execute /opt/app/oracle/product/19.3.0.2/database/root.sh on the following nodes: 
[dural]


Successfully Setup Software with warning(s).
As install user, execute the following command to complete the configuration.
        /opt/app/oracle/product/19.3.0.2/database/runInstaller -executeConfigTools -responseFile /home/oracle/db_install.rsp [-silent]


Moved the install session logs to:
 /opt/app/oraInventory/logs/InstallActions2020-11-19_06-23-29PM
```

Updated `create_test_server.yml` with these script names.

Created issue #[15](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/demos/issues/15) ("DURAL:
Optional configuration warning prevents DB SW Installation").

Shallahammer's Results
======================

[Craig Shallahammer](https://orapub.com) ran a webinar this morning to
demonstrate the effect of the Oracle Resource Manager under 100% CPU load. His
results do not show any differences in the transaction rates. There is not
enough data collected from the online demonstration to do any statistical
analysis.
