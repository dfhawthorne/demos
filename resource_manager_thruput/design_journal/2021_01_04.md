# 2021-01-04: Custom Performance Load Script

## Overview

Instead of using a generated load test script, I am now generating the load
using a custom script created from a Jinja2 template.

# Generate Custom Script

When I run the generated performance load script from HammerDB, the __DURAL__
system was I/O-constrained. The default TPC-C workload is not suitable for my
purpose of investigating CPU-constrained workloads.

"[5. Configure Driver](https://www.hammerdb.com/docs/ch09s05.html)" says:
> The loaded script can be viewed with the print script command. Note that the
> driver script is exactly the same as the driver script observed in the GUI.
> There is no difference whatsoever in what is run in the CLI compared to the
> GUI. If there is a wish to change the script a modified version can be loaded
> with the __customscript command__ and it is therefore recommended to use the
> GUI to save a version of the script to modify.

## Get Default Script

As discussed in the journal entry for [2020-12-30](2020_12_30.md), I need to
run the command, `diset tpcc ora_driver timed`, in order to the real performance
script. The default one is just for validating the TPC-C benchmark set-up.

I ran the following HammerDB commands:
```tcl
diset tpcc ora_driver timed
loadscript
print script
```

## Performance Script Names

An edited version of the generated script was converted to the Jinja2
template, "[custom_load.tcl.j2](../tmeplates/custom_load.tcl.j2)".

The name of this script is stored in the variable, `custom_load_test_script`,
which is defined in "[client.yml](../inventory/group_vars/client.yml)".

This script is generated in the playbook,
"[run_hammerdb_test.yml](../run_hammerdb_test.yml)".

## Designing CPU Intensive SQL

Since the default TPC-C workload

I ran the following SQL to see candidate tables:
```sql
SELECT table_name, num_rows, blocks FROM dba_tables WHERE owner='TPCC'
```
The result was:
| TABLE\_NAME |   NUM\_ROWS |     BLOCKS |
| ---------- | ----------:| ----------:|
| DISTRICT   |         10 |         13 |
| CUSTOMER   |     30,000 |      2,512 |
| HISTORY    |     30,000 |        244 |
| ITEM       |    100,000 |      1,126 |
| WAREHOUSE  |          1 |          5 |
| STOCK      |    100,000 |      4,402 |
| ORDERS     |     30,000 |        244 |
| NEW_ORDER  |      9,000 |            |
| ORDER_LINE |    299,977 |            |

The `item` table is a possible candidate for SQL as it has 1,126 blocks:
```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM tpcc.item
```
The first execution gives:
```
Elapsed: 00:00:01.01

Execution Plan
----------------------------------------------------------
Plan hash value: 1537583476

-------------------------------------------------------------------
| Id  | Operation          | Name | Rows  | Cost (%CPU)| Time     |
-------------------------------------------------------------------
|   0 | SELECT STATEMENT   |      |     1 |   308   (1)| 00:00:01 |
|   1 |  SORT AGGREGATE    |      |     1 |            |          |
|   2 |   TABLE ACCESS FULL| ITEM |   100K|   308   (1)| 00:00:01 |
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Statistics
----------------------------------------------------------
     39  recursive calls
      0  db block gets
   1176  consistent gets
   1114  physical reads
      0  redo size
    550  bytes sent via SQL*Net to client
    392  bytes received via SQL*Net from client
      2  SQL*Net roundtrips to/from client
      6  sorts (memory)
      0  sorts (disk)
      1  rows processed
```
This is a good execution plan for getting a high CPU load. I will need at least
100 SQL executions per second in order to have a CPU running at 100% usage.

The second execution gives:
```
Elapsed: 00:00:00.01

Statistics
----------------------------------------------------------
      0  recursive calls
      0  db block gets
   1118  consistent gets
      0  physical reads
      0  redo size
    550  bytes sent via SQL*Net to client
    392  bytes received via SQL*Net from client
      2  SQL*Net roundtrips to/from client
      0  sorts (memory)
      0  sorts (disk)
      1  rows processed
```

Once the database cache has been primed, there are no physical I/Os.

# TNS Alias

Moved the `tns_alias` variable out of
"[install_hammerdb.yml](../install_hammerdb.yml)" into
"[all.yml](../inventory/group_vars/all.yml)".

This variable was added to the following files:
* "[create_tpcc_schema_parms.tcl.j2](../templates/create_tpcc_schema_parms.tcl.j2)"
* "[logon_oracle.tcl.inc](../templates/logon_oracle.tcl.inc)"
* "[run_hammerdb_test.tcl.j2](templates/run_hammerdb_test.tcl.j2)"

# Performance Test Driver Script

The performance test driver script,
"[run_hammerdb_test.tcl.j2](../templates/run_hammerdb_test.tcl.j2)", was
updated to:
* Remove the generation of the AWR snapshots (this is now done in the
custom load performance script
* Virtual user configuration is removed
