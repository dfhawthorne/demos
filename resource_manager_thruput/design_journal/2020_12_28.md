2020-12-28: Improved Idempoyency of Build of SUT
================================================

Overview
--------

I was able to compact the Ansible playbook,
"[configure_sut.yml](../configure_sut.yml)", by getting the TCL
script to run the necessary SQL queries.

Because of difficulties in setting the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment
variable, I had to retain the shell script to invoke the TCLSH
script instead of directly from the `COMMAND` module.

Design of Create TPCC Schema
============================

Design Overview
---------------

I had not realised that the HammerDB CLI environment automatically
sets up the TCL environment for the Oratcl package. Once I did so,
I was able to move the SQL code for counting TPCC objects from a
separate Python3 script into a TCLSH one.

With the discovery of the `auto` parameter on the `hammerdbcli`
command, I was able to create a general purpose shell for running
HammerDB scripts.

Repurpose HammerDBCLI Driver Script
-----------------------------------

Jinja2 template, "create_hammerdb_schema.sh.j2", was renamed to
"[run_hammerdb_script.sh.j2](../templates/run_hammerdb_script.sh.j2)" as the
functionality became mor general. The final script requires a parameter
which is the location of the TCL script to run.

Change Directory
---------------

The directpry change to the HammerDB home is now done within the
"[run_hammerdb_script.sh.j2](../templates/run_hammerdb_script.sh.j2)"
driver script instead of the Ansible playbook. This was done to
keep the percularities of running HammerDBCLI in one place.

Issue with LD_LIBRARY_PATH Environment Variable
===============================================

The environment variable, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, has to be set with the Oracle
Client library directory before the `hammerdbcli` command is invoked. Otherwise,
the following message appears:
```
Oratcl_Init(): Failed to load /opt/app/oracle/product/12.1.0.2/client/lib/libclntsh.so with error libmql1.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

    while executing
"load /usr/local/HammerDB-4.0/lib/Oratcl4.6/libOratcl4.6.so"
    ("package ifneeded Oratcl 4.6" script)
    invoked from within
"package require Oratcl"
    (file "/home/douglas/ora_logon.tcl" line 12)
    invoked from within
"source $autostart::autoloadscript"
    invoked from within
"if { $autostart::autostartap == "true" } {
        source $autostart::autoloadscript
        } else {
    TclReadLine::interact
        }"
    (file "./hammerdbcli" line 84)"
```

Ansible plybook lint gives the following error:
```
Running Ansible Lint on configure_sut.yml...
WARNING  Listing 1 violation(s) that are fatal
[304] Environment variables don't work as part of command
configure_sut.yml:90
Task/Handler: Create HammerDB Schema
```

However, testing reveals that this is not true. My test code is:
```yaml
  - name:               "Run HammerDBCLI"
    command:
      argv:
      -                 "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/app/oracle/product/12.1.0.2/client/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
      -                 "./hammerdbcli"
      -                 "auto"
      -                 "/home/douglas/ora_logon.tcl"
      chdir:            "/usr/local/HammerDB-4.0"
    failed_when:        false
    register:           cli
```

Except, my playbook does fail with:
```
{"changed": false,
"cmd": "'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/app/oracle/product/12.1.0.2/client/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' ./hammerdbcli auto /home/hammer/create_tpcc_schema_parms.tcl",
"msg": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: b'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/app/oracle/product/12.1.0.2/client/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH': b'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/app/oracle/product/12.1.0.2/client/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH'",
"rc": 2}
```

The code I used was:
```yaml
  - name:               "Create HammerDB Schema"
    command:
      argv:
      -                 "LD_LIBRARY_PATH={{ oracle_home }}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
      -                 "./hammerdbcli"
      -                 "auto"
      -                 "{{ create_tpcc_schema_parms_script }}"
      chdir:            "{{ hammerdb_loc }}"
    register:           create_script_result
    become:             yes
    become_user:        hammer
    when:               inventory_hostname in groups['client']
```

The only difference I see is the use of variables.
