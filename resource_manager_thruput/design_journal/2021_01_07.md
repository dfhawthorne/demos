# 2021-01-07: Fixed Several AWR-Related Bugs

## Overview

There were several AWR-related bugs that were caused by my misunderstanding of
how AWR data is stored in a CDB.

# Table of Contents

* [AWR Settings](#awr-settings)
* [Incorrect AWR Snapshots Reported](#incorrect-awr-snapshots-reported)

# AWR Settings

There are multiple AWR settings - one each for the CDB and each PDB.

Thus, I need to distinguish the relevant entry by the `SRC_DBNAME` column
in `DBA_HIST_WR_CONTROL`. Doing so resolved issue #28.

# Incorrect AWR Snapshots Reported

The custom load performance script reported the incorrect AWR snapshots from the
performance test. There are multiple sets of AWR snapshots - one each for the
CDB and for each PDB. They are separated by the column `CON_ID` in the
`DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT` view.

I have refrained from submitting a fix to the HammerDB open-source project
because the fix is more complex in that I would have to consider the version of
the database engine (CDB was introduced in 12C with changes to AWR management in
subsequent versions).
